Title of the project: 
Metabolomic profiling of 16 aminoacids in elderly patients with no cognitive impairment diagnosed 
and patients suffering from (i) mild cognitive impairment, (ii) mild dementia and (iii) moderate dementia.

An observational type-of-study.
All analyses were conducted in R .

Comparison: elderly patients (> 65 years of age) with no cognitive impairment diagnosed (n=28)  versus
those with mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia and moderate dementia (n=95).

Research question: Are there any differences between aminoacids concentrations  beteen both groups.

Conclusions:

Based on 16 aminoacidsâ€™ concentrations we cannot observe any separation between either patients with and without mental disorders or men/women. 
The LC-fluorescence detection data generated in this experiment are characterized by normal distribution, however the experimental sample was highly
unbalanced which excluded the possibility of modeling these data without prior balancing. The RF together with ROSE algorithm was used to form an ensemble of decision trees, 
each of which fitted the data and averaging the results to find a better classification. However, it should be emphasized that obtained results should 
be interpreted with caution and their generalization on the larger population should be avoided. More individuals should be enrolled to fully confirm the
validity of top 4 selected variables contributing to the classification between both groups of patients.
